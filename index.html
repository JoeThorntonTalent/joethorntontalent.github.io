<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>I joined <a href="http://playfaircapital.com">Playfair Capital</a> in 2013 and focus on consumer and enterprise technology-enabled investments, specifically deal sourcing, due diligence, and ongoing portfolio support. I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, infrastructure-as-a-service, mobile-first on-demand consumer apps, enterprise productivity software, as well as genomics. Within the portfolio, I focus on product design, analytics, and growth, while providing support for companies raising their next round of financing.</p>

<p>At Playfair, I've led, originated or participated in seed, Series A and Series B investments for high-growth companies including <a href="http://mapillary.com">Mapillary</a>, <a href="http://appearhere.co.uk">Appear Here</a>, <a href="http://dojoapp.co">Dojo</a>, and <a href="http://festicket.com">Festicket</a>. Prior to Playfair, I earned an M.Phil and Ph.D in oncology as a Gates and Dr. Herchel Smith Scholar at the University of Cambridge, and a BA in biology from Williams College. I've published research focused on technologies to halt the fatal spread of cancer around the body.</p>
